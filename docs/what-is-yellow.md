## Features of Yellow.org

### Non-Custodial

Transferring your assets to the Exchange is replaced with a MetaMask connection. Your funds are secured using a multi-signature smart contract on the blockchain. You can fully audit the assets held by the exchange. 

### Access to Market Pairs

We understand how it is important to have stable access to different Market pairs, despite the blockchain technologies that are used for their maintenance. Thus, we operate with Wrapped tokens (WBTC for BTC as an example) which provide flexibility and operational speed for various markets.

### Information security

It is vital to secure personal data in the era of hacks and leaks. We donâ€™t share any transaction details or sensitive information about the Platform user except what is mandatory, KYC level, in this case. This way your personal information is safe and transactional privacy is respected.

### High-speed trading

Built on top of the XLN protocol, Yellow has deep liquidity and tight spread while enabling traditional market-making and high-frequency trading.
