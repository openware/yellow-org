# What is XLN?

XLN stands for eXchange Liquidity Network, it's a network of peer exchanges.

What XLN does, is aggregates liquidity and price feed from a huge number of sources and shares these with connected users.

## XLN is a layer-2 network

Blockchains provide transactions on so-called layer-1. The more transactions performed on a blockchain, the more expensive they are.

Layer-2 scaling solutions allow performing transactions faster and chipper. State channels layer-2 solution does not require node validation for every transaction. A state channel comprises a set of open-source protocols, smart contracts, interfaces, and software that enable blockchain applications to run "off-chain" on state channel networks. The layer-1 blockchain records only the final state after multiple transactions. 

XLN is a step forward for such scaling solutions. We could call it “layer-3”. It connects multiple exchange platforms in a broad network, that provides price feed and shares liquidity. 

The network allows high-frequency trading and can be accessed through multiple layer-1 blockchains using state channels.

## Network overview

XLN provides a protocol for connecting different exchange platforms to a network. 

Built on XLN applications get a high-frequency matching engine that utilizes all the network liquidity and a respective price feed. 

End-users of connected platforms get fast decentralized 2P2 exchange. But this DEX will embrace liquidity from the entire network.

## XLN impact

XLN aggregates price and liquidity from multiple decentralized sources, provides chipper and faster services, and thus makes centralized exchanges obsolete.
