# What is XLN?

XLN stands for eXchange Liquidity Network, it's an OpenDAX network of peer exchanges.

XLN aggregates liquidity and price feed from a huge number of sources and shares these with connected users.

The next generation of XLN will spread this principle to decentralized platforms and shift the market to the next level.

## XLN is a layer 2 network
Blockchains validate transactions on so-called layer-1. The higher a load of transactions on the blockchain, the more expensive they are.

Layer-2 scaling solutions allow performing transactions faster and chipper. State channels layer-2 solution does not require node validation for every transaction. A state channel comprises a set of open-source protocols, smart contracts, interfaces, and software that enable blockchain applications to run "off-chain" on state channel networks. The layer-1 blockchain validates only the final state after multiple transactions. 

XLN is a step forward for such scaling solutions. We could call it “layer-3”. It will connect multiple exchange platforms in a broad network, that provides price feed and shares liquidity. 

The network will allow high-frequency trading and will be accessible for multiple layer-1 blockchains through state channels.

## Network overview
XLN provides a protocol for connecting different exchange platforms to a network. 

Built on XLN applications will get a high-frequency matching engine that utilizes all the network liquidity and a respective price feed. 

End-users of connected platforms will get fast decentralized P2P exchange. But this DEX will embrace liquidity from the entire network.

## XLN main ideas recap
- network of opted-in nodes and connected external DEX platforms

- oracle-like and forex brokerage FIX protocol-like price feed

- P2P network with aggregated liquidity and censorship protection based on DEX

- network of layer-2 state channels with super high-speed trading and settling

- layer-2 consensus-free transactions that do not require blockchain fees

- the upper layer for blockchain operations  

XLN will aggregate price and liquidity from multiple decentralized sources, provide chipper and faster services, and thus will make centralized exchanges obsolete.
