## Features of Yellow.org

### Non-Custodial

Transferring your assets to the Exchange is replaced with Metamask connection.
Your funds are secured using a multi-signature smart-contract on the blockchain. You can fully audit the assets held by the exchange. 

### Access to Market Pairs

We understand how it is important to have the stable access to different Market pairs, despite the blockchain technologies that are used for their maintanance. Thus we operate with Wrapped tokens (WBTC for BTC as example) which provides us with flexibility and operational speed for various markets.
