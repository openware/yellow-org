# Custody

**“The new normal”** is a phrase that we always hear nowadays, and it can also apply to blockchain technology. With the surge of adaptation in the cryptocurrency space, we have seen prices rise to all-time highs in the recent year. More and more people are learning and trading cryptocurrencies across the world. While this is generally a good thing, it has also exposed some down sides with the blockchains that were created almost a decade ago. With the ethereum chain, for example, gas fees skyrocketed and transactions took longer to confirm, due to the amount of traffic the past few months. Crypto exchanges solve this problem by allowing users to deposit funds into their exchanges, and provide a platform for users to trade with each other. This, however, exposed a lot of security risks as many exchanges got hacked, and resulted in users losing their entire holdings. This brings us to the new era of blockchain by using state channel technology along with our custody wallet.

###So what are state channels?

 State channels refer to the process in which users transact with one another directly outside of the blockchain, or “off-chain”. This methodology greatly minimizes the use of ‘on-chain’ operations by only involving opening and closing of the state channels. By moving operations off-chain, the possibilities are endless, we are no longer restricted to on-chain protocols that were written almost a decade ago. On-chain operations are slow, as they require users to wait for new blocks, and expensive, as all transactions require a gas fee. State channels solve this by doing operations off chain, where they are near-instant and free. This solves the problem of speed and cost, **what about security?** Custody solutions would provide the best approach for this.

###Custody solutions
 are independent storage and security systems used to hold large quantities of tokens. The main utility of cryptocurrency custody solutions lies in the safeguarding of cryptocurrency assets. Private keys, which are used to conduct transactions or access crypto holdings, are a complex combination of alphanumerics. They are extremely difficult to remember and can be stolen or hacked. Online wallets or crypto exchanges are a potential solution but they have also proven susceptible to hacks. Our custody solutions will provide a secure environment by connecting via a verified crypto gateway like MetaMask, then the user's deposit goes to a safe cold-wallet of one of our certified provider partners (like Fireblocks). Once the assets are deposited, all transactions are now processed off-chain. Their assets are always secure due to this 2nd layer which is implemented in our OpenDAX v4 deposit/withdrawal system.

###What does the future hold?

 After developing off-chain operations, we are now looking into developing cross-chain solutions. We want to bridge the gap between different blockchains.  Cross-chain bridges allow for the transfer of assets, tokens, data or even smart contract instructions from one chain to another and between completely independent platforms, enabling users to deploy digital assets on one blockchain to dApps on another. It allows us to conduct fast, low-cost transactions of tokens hosted on non-scalable blockchains. Furthermore, we can  implement and execute dApps across more than one platform. Stay tuned for more updates in the coming months!
