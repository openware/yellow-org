# Custody

## State Channels

**What are state channels?**

State channels are a technology that lets us radically improve the UX and scalability of applications built on blockchains like Ethereum.
State channels refer to the process in which users transact with one another directly outside of the blockchain, or 'off-chain,' and greatly minimize their use of 'on-chain' operations. On-chain operations only involve opening and closing the channel.

**What are the benefits of state channels?**

The core value of state channels is simple: for certain types of applications, channels are always cheaper, faster, and more private than a regular on-chain transaction.
Blockchain operations are expensive (we have to pay transaction fees) and they are slow (we have to wait for new blocks). Even on ETH 2.0, transactions will still require waiting for the next block, and fees will still need to be paid.
State channels let us do operations off chain, where they can be near-instantaneous and free. This means that users in a game can get instant feedback, or parties can exchange many thousands of payments or trades, with no limit to their speed except their underlying communications protocol.


## Cross-Chain 

**What are Cross-chain bridges?**

Cross-Chain Bridges enable interoperability and intercommunication between vastly different networks, such Bitcoin and Ethereum for instance, and between one parent blockchain and its child chain, known as a sidechain, which either operates under different consensus rules or inherits its security from the parent blockchain, as is the case for Polkadot and Kusama parachains.
Cross-chain bridges allow for the transfer of assets, tokens, data or ever smart contract instructions from one chain to another and between completely independent platforms, enabling users to:

<ul>
<li>Deploy digital assets on one blockchain to dApps on another.</li>
<li>Conduct fast, low-cost transactions of tokens hosted on non-scalable blockchains.</li>
<li>Implement and execute dApps across more than one platform.</li>
</ul>


## Security

**What is custody?**

Custody solutions are independent storage and security systems used to hold large quantities of tokens. Custodians would hold this asset on behalf of two transacting parties.

**What are the benefits of having custody?**

The main utility of cryptocurrency custody solutions lies in the safeguarding of cryptocurrency assets. Private keys, which are used to conduct transactions or access crypto holdings, are a complex combination of alphanumerics. They are extremely difficult to remember and can be stolen or hacked. Online wallets are a potential solution but they have also proven susceptible to hacks. The same is true of cryptocurrency exchanges. In our case, we will use this system along with state channel protocols, to open a safer trading environment for users.
